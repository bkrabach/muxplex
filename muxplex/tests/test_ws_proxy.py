    terminal.js sends {"AuthToken": ""} as a TEXT WebSocket frame. The original

    and exited — meaning ttyd never received the auth token, never started
    streaming, resulting in a permanent black screen and reconnect loop.

    The proxy MUST use receive() and dispatch on message type to handle both
    binary and text frames correctly.
